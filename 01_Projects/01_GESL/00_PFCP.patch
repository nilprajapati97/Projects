âœ… 1. High-Level Overview (Control & User Plane Separation)
What is CUPS (Control and User Plane Separation)?

Introduced in 3GPP Release 14, CUPS enables:

Independent scaling of control plane (CP) and user plane (UP).

Reduced latency by placing UPF near the edge (MEC).

Dynamic UPF selection based on user location.
