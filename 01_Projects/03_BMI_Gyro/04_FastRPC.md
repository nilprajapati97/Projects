To understand **how your custom FastRPC-based sensor communication fits into Qualcomm's Sensor Framework on SLPI (Sensor Low Power Island)**, we need to break down the **Qualcomm SLPI architecture**, **sensor stack**, and **how sensor drivers are managed** on the **DSP**, not the Application Processor (AP).

This framework is **already prebuilt into SLPI firmware** (`slpi.mbn`) and handles sensor drivers (like BMI160), buffering, event generation, batching, and FastRPC communication with Android.

---

## üß† What is Qualcomm's Sensor Framework on SLPI?

It is a **Sensor Manager + driver framework** running on SLPI (a QDSP variant), that:

* Manages I2C/SPI sensors directly
* Loads sensor drivers as shared libraries (`.so`)
* Handles sensor registration, calibration, timestamps, batching, and FIFO
* Interacts with the Application Processor via **FastRPC + QMI**
* Offloads all real-time sensor processing from Linux (AP) to DSP (SLPI)

## üîß How Your `.idl` Fits into This Framework

### ‚úÖ Scenario 1: Using Qualcomm‚Äôs Sensor Framework (RECOMMENDED)

You **don't need to write your own FastRPC .idl** if:

* The **sensor is supported** by Qualcomm's **precompiled SLPI sensor framework** (e.g., BMI160).
* Your job is to enable it via:

  * Device tree
  * Platform data
  * Registry configuration

The framework already includes:

* **SLPI drivers** (`libsns_bmi160.so`)
* **Sensor Manager**
* **Sensors Registry**
* **Timestamps, calibration, FIFO buffering**

All communication between **Sensor HAL on AP ‚Üî SLPI** is done via pre-defined FastRPC interfaces internally handled by Qualcomm‚Äôs shared libraries (`libsensor1.so`, `sensor.h`, etc.).

---

### ‚ùó Scenario 2: You Want to Add a Custom Sensor Driver

In this case, you would:

* Write a **custom sensor driver** using Qualcomm's **Sensor Driver Framework (SDF)**.
* Build it as a shared object (`.so`) using **Hexagon SDK**.
* Integrate it into **SLPI firmware (slpi.mbn)**.
* Register it with **Sensors Manager on DSP** using `sns_sensor_instance` framework.
* Register config using `registry` entries.

You **still wouldn‚Äôt need a separate .idl** unless you bypass the whole framework and manually implement your own RPC pipe ‚Äî which is discouraged unless absolutely required (e.g., for testing or unsupported peripherals).

---

## üß± Sensor Driver Structure (Inside SLPI)

Every SLPI sensor driver using SDF includes:

1. `sns_sensor.c`

   * Entry point for the driver
   * Registers with Sensor Manager
   * Creates sensor instances

2. `sns_sensor_instance.c`

   * Handles events, I2C transactions
   * Communicates with hardware (BMI160)

3. `sns_bmi160.proto`

   * Configuration messages
   * Defines sensor attributes (range, units, etc.)

4. `registry`

   * Stores calibration, mounting matrix, etc.

5. `libsns_bmi160.so`

   * Compiled shared object loaded into SLPI

---

## üìÅ SLPI Partition Contains

```
slpi.mbn
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libsns_bmi160.so            # Sensor driver
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libsns_smgr.so              # Sensor Manager
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libsensor_reg.so            # Registry services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libsns_std_sensor.so        # Standard APIs
```

---

## üìû Communication Path to Android App

1. App ‚Üí SensorManager ‚Üí Sensor HAL
2. Sensor HAL uses **`libsensor1.so`** (FastRPC + QMI)
3. Communicates with **SLPI Sensor Framework**
4. Data returned in `sensors_event_t` to Android app

---

## üß™ Debug & Tracing Tools

* `logcat -s Sensors`
* `adb shell cat /d/sensors/*`
* `adb shell cat /sys/class/sensors/`
* Registry dump: `/persist/sensors/sensor_def_qcomdev.conf`
* Check `/dev/fastrpc-sensors` is used

## ‚úÖ Summary: When to Use Custom `.idl` vs Sensor Framework

| Case                          | Use Sensor Framework | Use Custom `.idl` |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| BMI160 or other common sensor | ‚úÖ                    | ‚ùå                 |
| Unsupported sensor            | ‚úÖ (write driver)     | ‚ùå                 |
| Experimental/test interface   | ‚ùå                    | ‚úÖ                 |
| Want manual DSP logic control | ‚ùå                    | ‚úÖ                 |
