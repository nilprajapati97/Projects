ThinOS is a lightweight, read-only, highly secure operating system developed by Dell/Wyse for thin client devices. It's primarily used in VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) environments and is designed to provide remote desktop access without allowing local app execution or persistent storage.

Hereâ€™s an in-depth explanation of the ThinOS project from both client and server perspectives â€” suitable for a 10-year experienced Linux/Embedded developer in interviews.

ðŸ”· 1. What is ThinOS?
====================================================================================================
ThinOS runs on thin clients â€” low-power embedded hardware that offloads all heavy compute to a remote desktop or application server (typically Windows Server, Citrix, VMware, or Microsoft RDP).

It's a closed OS (not Linux-based), stored in firmware (read-only), and non-writable by users, hence very secure.
