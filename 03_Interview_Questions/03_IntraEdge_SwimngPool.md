✅ Project Context:
============================================
Design and implement an embedded controller that automates and monitors a smart swimming pool system. This system handles temperature regulation, pH level monitoring, lighting, pump control, chlorine dispensers, water level sensing, and cloud connectivity

✅ 1. Design Constraints (Important for Interview)
======================================================
| Constraint             | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Real-time behavior** | Pump, heater, and dispenser must respond to sensor input immediately.       |
| **Power management**   | Embedded controller must consume low power; solar power or UPS support.     |
| **Waterproofing/IP**   | Electronics must be housed in IP67+ enclosures to resist pool water damage. |
| **Long uptime**        | System should operate continuously with auto-reboot on crash.               |
| **Remote updates**     | OTA firmware updates must be supported securely.                            |
| **Security**           | Encrypt cloud traffic, isolate interfaces (firewall/IPTables).              |
| **Integration**        | Must support Wi-Fi, BLE or Zigbee for mobile or cloud integration.          |
| **Safety critical**    | Chemical dispensing must have interlocks to avoid overdosing.               |

✅ 4. Key Features
===============================================================================================================
Temperature Control – Reads waterproof DS18B20 sensor, controls heater relay.
pH Monitoring – Reads analog voltage from a pH probe, calculates value.
Chemical Dosing – Controls peristaltic pump for chlorine/bromine dosing.
Water Level Detection – Ultrasonic sensor or float switch.
Lighting – RGB LED strip controlled via PWM.
Scheduling – RTC-based scheduler (run pumps for N minutes every 6 hrs).
Mobile App / Web UI – Real-time data via MQTT or HTTP REST.

✅ 5. Interview Explanation Summary (Speak like this):
===============================================================================================================
"I worked on a smart swimming pool automation system using Embedded Linux (Yocto-based). I integrated water-quality sensors (pH, ORP), temperature sensors, and water-level detectors via I2C/ADC interfaces. The system controlled heaters and pumps via GPIO-relay modules.

I implemented the control logic as a C++ daemon using state machines and used MQTT to push telemetry to the cloud. Secure OTA updates were handled via SWUpdate with U-Boot dual-slot bootloader. To ensure reliability, we had a watchdog daemon and persistent logging via journald.

For security, all remote connections were TLS encrypted, and iptables firewalls restricted open ports. I also wrote kernel-level drivers for the ADC controller and used udev rules to detect sensor hardware on startup."
