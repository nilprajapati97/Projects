01. uint32_t big_endian_data = (0x11223344 & 0x000000FF )<< 24; 
    01. Explain how compiler get info and how CPU store and what operation will do.
    02. How it will fect value and instruction wrt stack pointer and program counter.
02. What is Compiler optimization
    What type of Ddefault Compiler optimize.
03. What is volatile?
04. When you will do operation with volatile how compiler or CPU differenciate with tha
    with normal variable. And How memory mapping to both normal and volatile variable.
05. What is ISR and How CPU get to know which address we need to go for ISR.
    Not in LDD context. Explain in Contoller context.
06. In project where you used mutithreading and why?
07.
